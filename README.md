This project aims to develop a multimodal retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system leveraging the Colpali retrival model. The system will be capable of processing and generating text and images in response to user queries,giving it multimodal ability.

Retrieval System:

Efficiently retrieves relevant information from a diverse knowledge base, including text, code, and images.
Leverages techniques like semantic search and vector databases to ensure accurate retrieval.

RAG Pipeline:

Combines the strengths of the Colpali retrival model and the retrieval system to generate comprehensive and informative responses.

Processes user queries, retrieves relevant information, and generates responses in text.
